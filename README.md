v1.0:
Really simple code to compute the moving average of a certain sequence of numbers using a circular buffer. Keep in mind that it stores the moving average vector inside the object of the class, although it can be modified so it only stores in memory the circular buffer and its pointer.

The system requires the following libraries:
* numpy
* matplotlib (to run the example)
